<li>this is another page! how did you get here.</li>
<li>I don't know how it ends, I can't see it in the distance
  But can you ever reach the end of a timeless existence?
  
  I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
  I'll fly under no conditions
  Teach myself complete submission
  While I grant myself complete permission
  
  Just imagine being human, hating your confusion
  Denying 'til it's proven, laughing at illusion
  Thinking institution's the solution
  While tyranny and irony float in it's pollution</li>
